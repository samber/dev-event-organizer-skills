# Skills for tech event organizers

**Technical event operations**: conferences, meetups, hackathons, and the community programs around them.

Written for **event organizers, conference producers, hackathon leads, and community builders**, covering strategy through day-of production. Every skill is **tool-agnostic**: it teaches the decision, not one vendor's ticketing console.
