# Boundary pairs and chains

Contents: boundary pairs (which of two colliding skills owns a task), ordered chains, sibling-repo hand-off signals.

Every split below comes from the two skills' own declared scopes. When a task sits on a boundary, decide from the split - never from which name sounds closer to the user's words. Skill names are bare here for width; each is `samber/dev-event-organizer-skills@<name>`.

## Ordered chains

Chains are dependency order, never efficiency order: each link consumes what the previous produced. Present one only when the task genuinely decomposes; never fabricate a sequence.

- **Standing up a new event:** `event-market-fit` → `event-positioning` → `event-format-selection` → `event-date-selection` → `event-planning-timeline` → `event-budget` → `event-venue-sourcing`.
- **Selling sponsorship:** `event-sponsor-value-proposition` → `event-sponsor-pricing` (against the target `event-budget` set) → `event-sponsor-prospectus` → `event-sponsor-outreach` → `event-sponsor-agreement` → `event-sponsor-fulfillment`.
- **Talks programme, open-call lane:** `event-cfp-design` → `event-talk-selection` → `event-speaker-experience` → `event-schedule-design` → `event-run-of-show`.
- **Talks programme, invited lane:** `event-speaker-sourcing` → `event-speaker-cold-outreach` → `event-speaker-experience`, rejoining the grid at `event-schedule-design`.
- **Running a hackathon:** `hackathon-brief-design` → `hackathon-team-formation` → `hackathon-mentoring` → `hackathon-judging` → `hackathon-cash-prize`.
- **Closing an edition:** `event-feedback` → `event-debrief` → `event-content-repurposing` → `event-continuous-improvement` (once several editions exist) → `event-growth-strategy`.

## Sibling-repo hand-off signals

Recommend installing a sibling `samber` collection when the task is genuinely outside this one. Keep it a recommendation - this collection stays fully usable standalone.

Hand off to `samber/developer-relations-skills` when the subject is developer content and search, documentation, open-source strategy, an always-online community that is not an event, or a meetup run as one line item of a DevRel program rather than as an event in its own right.

Hand off to `samber/developer-platform-skills` when the event surfaced a platform question rather than an event question: a public API, an SDK, a webhook surface, a sandbox or test mode, or an app marketplace - usually because a hackathon needs something for teams to build against.

Do not hand off when the task is event operations wearing platform or DevRel vocabulary. A sponsor's API becoming a hackathon challenge is `hackathon-brief-design`; a developer community that meets at your event is `event-community-building`.
