# Provision catalog, with provenance

Every provision below carries where it came from and which edition it describes. Nothing here is an industry norm; each item is one organization's published practice at one point in time. Transpose the pattern, not the vendor and not the figure.

Provenance labels used throughout:

- **LF template** - a foundation's standardized "Inclusion & Accessibility" page, republished near-verbatim across many of its events. Vendor names on that page are examples of a category, never requirements.
- **PyCon 2019 (historical)** - a large community conference's own accessibility, childcare and financial-aid pages from 2019. The current site carries no equivalent accessibility page (re-checked 2026-09-11: the current PyCon US FAQ page names only a general "Support page" contact route, with no dedicated accessibility, childcare, floor-map, captioning, or interpretation page). Cite this as historical practice; never present it as what that event does today.
- **FOSDEM 2026** - that event's own short accessibility page.
- **c3subtitles** - a crowdsourced post-event subtitling project with public repositories.
- **Hackathon guide** - a large student-hackathon network's public organizer guide.
- **IACC** - a meetings-industry venue association's own published dietary-requirements guide, produced with several catering and meetings-industry bodies.
- **AdaCamp Toolkit** - a defunct tech/open-culture unconference series' public organizer toolkit, its content still live and citable.

## The depth range across sourced events

Published organizer practice is uneven, and the range itself is the finding - never present a single event as baseline practice.

| Depth              | Sourced example                     | What is actually published                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Near-zero          | Hackathon guide                      | One venue-checklist line plus dietary restrictions; nothing on captioning, quiet space, childcare or funded access.                                                                                                    |
| Thin                | FOSDEM 2026                           | Step-free routing tool, a wheelchair-access claim, best-effort front seating, guide dogs, a feedback address; no quiet space (a public park named as the alternative), no captioning.                                  |
| Scattered           | devopsdays city guides                | A few lines inside venue and logistics pages; no dedicated page.                                                                                                                                                       |
| Full, per-edition  | PyCon 2019 (historical)               | Dedicated page, floor maps, captioning on main-conference days only, interpretation on request, subsidized childcare, a travel grant program. The current site carries no equivalent page.                            |
| Full, templated     | LF template                           | One standardized page republished near-verbatim across many events: per-room live captioning, complimentary childcare, nursing room, reserved seating, a named quiet space, consent stickers, all-gender restrooms, equipment rental. |

Treat the two full rows as promotable, high-effort targets, never as a bar every organizer already clears.

## Physical access

| Provision                 | Sourced shape                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Step-free routing         | A public routing tool with an "avoid stairs" setting, plus a stated claim of which rooms are wheelchair accessible and which are not (FOSDEM 2026)                                                                      |
| Floor maps                | Published maps marking event areas, elevators, stairs, bathrooms and nursing stations by location (PyCon 2019, historical)                                                                                              |
| Accessible bathrooms      | A specific checkable claim - "the unisex bathrooms are wheelchair accessible" - rather than a general accessibility assertion (PyCon 2019, historical)                                                                  |
| Hotel access              | Room-block hotels separately confirmed accessible, with maps on request, and the scarcity stated plainly: each hotel holds a limited number of accessible rooms, so ask early (PyCon 2019, historical)                  |
| Venue access questions    | Routed through staff at registration and info desks rather than a published map (LF template) - an alternative to publishing, not a substitute for knowing the answer                                                   |
| Mobility-equipment rental | A named third-party rental vendor for wheelchairs and scooters, contacted directly by the attendee (LF template). The pattern is naming _a_ vendor at all; most published events leave the attendee to source their own |
| Reserved seating          | Available in **each session** for attendees with access needs (LF template), versus best-effort front seating with no named process (FOSDEM 2026)                                                                       |
| Service animals           | One sourced policy admits licensed guide dogs for the blind only (FOSDEM 2026) - narrower than most events state. Decide your own scope explicitly rather than inheriting this one                                      |
| Companion or attendant    | Registers separately and free, by contacting organizers directly rather than through a self-service form, and receives the same badge and catering as the attendee they accompany (PyCon 2019, historical)              |

## Sensory and social-load provisions

- **Quiet space, two distinct rationales.** One sourced page frames its named quiet space around _interaction_ load (LF template). It states: "a physical space where conversation and interaction are not allowed, where attendees can go if for any reason they can't interact with other attendees at that time." Others frame the same room around sensory input, noise and light. State which rationale yours serves, because it changes the room you ask the venue for.
- **The honest counter-example.** One major event provides no quiet space on campus at all and names a public park five minutes away as the alternative on its own page (FOSDEM 2026). This is a stated absence, not an omission - cite it whenever a quiet room is being presented as universal practice.
- **Sizing, and the absence of a formal standard.** No seat-to-attendee ratio or square-footage-per-attendee formula for a quiet or sensory room was found in any sourced accessible-conference guide, ACM conference accessibility page, or sensory-certification program - treat any such figure seen elsewhere as a vendor estimate, not an industry standard. The one sourced number is an operational observation rather than a codified rule: one unconference series found "a maximum of around 5% of our attendees might be in the quiet room at any one time" (AdaCamp Toolkit), a share of attendees rather than a seat or square-footage count. The same source's non-numeric siting rules: moderately sized, sited away from the main hub, dim lighting, wheelchair-accessible entrance and interior, and separate from any nursing room.
- **Interaction-consent stickers.** Colour-coded, self-selected, picked up at registration: green means open to communicate, yellow means only if you know me, red means not interested in communicating or in being photographed or filmed (LF template). One artifact carrying two access needs - a social-boundary signal and a recording opt-out.
- **Pronoun stickers.** Opt-in, picked up at registration (LF template). Whether they are opt-in stickers or a printed badge default is this skill's call; what the choice _says_ belongs to `samber/dev-event-organizer-skills@event-cultural-identity`.
- **All-gender restrooms.** Designated specifically and named as such (LF template).
- **Nursing room.** Two sourced postures: exists unconditionally with only its location withheld until check-in (LF template), versus its existence withheld behind a contact request to a named coordinator (PyCon 2019, historical). The first reaches people who would never ask.

## Captioning, interpretation and subtitles

- **Per-room live captioning** delivered by a named vendor, with instructions posted in each breakout room (LF template) - the top of the sourced range, and the only sourced example of captioning delivered beyond a plenary.
- **Day-scoped live captioning**: the main conference days captioned, the tutorial and sprint days explicitly not (PyCon 2019, historical). The scoping is legitimate; publishing it is what makes it legitimate.
- **Interpretation on request**: "we do not plan to have interpreters at the conference unless we are notified by signing attendees" (PyCon 2019, historical). Note what this proves - captioning and interpretation are not bundled at the same trigger threshold even at a well-resourced conference.
- **Post-event crowdsourced subtitling**: a standing volunteer project with its own repositories and a queue tool tracking which talks still need subtitles, organizationally and temporally separate from the live production pipeline (c3subtitles). It adds languages a live captioning vendor rarely offers, weeks after the fact. It is never a substitute for live provision in the room.
- **The gap worth noticing**: one event with an exceptionally capable broadcast operation publishes no captioning provision at all on its accessibility page (FOSDEM 2026). Production capacity and a stated provision are different things, held by different people.

## Dietary accommodation

Two sourced organizations, at different depths.

- **Categories to ask about (hackathon guide)**: vegetarian, vegan, celiac and gluten-free, common allergies (lactose and peanut named specifically), kosher, halal.
- **Categories to ask about (IACC), in three separate registration groups rather than one free-text box**: common diets (vegetarian, vegan, pescatarian, ketogenic, paleo, MIND diet, flexitarian, Whole30), health-related diets (gluten-free, celiac disease, diabetes), and religious/cultural diets broken out by faith (Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism, Christianity, Baha'i - each with its own forbidden-foods and fasting-period detail).
- **The eight most common allergens (IACC)**: peanuts, tree nuts, shellfish, fish, milk, eggs, soy, wheat - with sesame flagged as an emerging ninth, already a listed top allergen in the EU, Australia, Japan and Canada.
- **Ask everyone who will be fed** - attendees, mentors, volunteers and staff - before the event, so the order can be adjusted in advance rather than improvised on the day (hackathon guide).
- **Two fallback paths when the standard order cannot cover a restriction (hackathon guide):**
  - A one-off request to the existing supplier for a small number of prepared meals.
  - A delivery credit given to the affected attendee _with advance notice_ that they are sourcing their own meal, so they can plan around it.
- **Distribution safeguard (hackathon guide)**: hold restricted meals at a separate table from the general line and check names off a printed list as they are handed out, so they are not taken by the wrong person. The same instruction appears verbatim in two separate documents of that guide, which is what marks it as standing practice rather than incidental advice.

Whichever categories the event commits to, the commitment goes into the catering brief through `samber/dev-event-organizer-skills@event-vendor-sourcing` - this catalog decides the list, not the order.

## Contact, ownership and response

- **Name individuals, not a role alias.** Both poles do this: a dedicated accessibility address staffed by two named people (PyCon 2019, historical), and named staff contacts with titles and emails, one with a phone number (LF template).
- **Say the process is unfinished when it is.** One sourced FAQ answers a mobility question and appends "check back soon!" rather than papering over an unresolved gap, and frames the whole page as a continuous process (PyCon 2019, historical). Honest incompleteness reads better than a confident claim that fails in the room.
- **Offer a feedback route.** A dedicated address for accessibility improvement suggestions (FOSDEM 2026) - cheap, and the only sourced mechanism that turns this edition's failures into next edition's provisions.
- **Tie the page to the code of conduct.** The sourced template opens by naming who it wants to feel welcome and links the two documents, and its harassment-response section states the established response process it follows (LF template). Write the tie; the policy itself stays with `samber/dev-event-organizer-skills@event-code-of-conduct`.
