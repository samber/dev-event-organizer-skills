## 1. The competing-event scan, step by step

The DevOpsDays organizing guide frames this check as **"load balancing"** across the field, not turf protection: the field is better off when its events are spread out. An organizer who only asks "does this hurt me" misses the events that hurt the audience by stacking.

1. **List your own event family first.** Any event network with a shared homepage lists its scheduled editions; this is the cheapest hit and the one the DevOpsDays guide names directly. It is also the narrowest - it surfaces only events branded like yours.
2. **Widen to adjacent topics and different organizers.** This is the gap step 1 cannot close, and where most real conflicts live: your attendees choose between your event and _any_ event they would spend the same travel budget on, not only ones in your category.
3. **Consult a cross-topic public conference calendar.** A crowdsourced dataset such as confs.tech is one example of the kind of tool that does this - named as an example of the category, not as a dependency. Its coverage is contributed by organizers who already know about it, so absence from it proves nothing.
4. **Add a call-for-papers listing scan.** CFP aggregators surface events that have not yet announced dates publicly but have already claimed a window, which a calendar of confirmed events misses.
5. **Check local, non-topical events** in the host city across each candidate window: marathons, festivals, trade fairs, major sporting fixtures. They take venues, hotel inventory, transit, and local attention regardless of subject.
6. **Ask two or three people in the audience** what else they are planning to attend that season. This catches the events no aggregator lists - regional meetup series, company user conferences, internal engineering weeks - and it is usually the highest-yield ten minutes in the whole scan.
7. **Record every hit with the decision made on it**, not just the hits you avoided. The rejected-window reasoning is the part that cannot be reconstructed next year.

## 2. Dodge or piggyback: deciding per event

The DevOpsDays guide names **piggybacking** as a deliberate tactic, not a consolation: scheduling immediately before or after another major event in the same city so travelling attendees justify one trip for both. That makes proximity a two-sided variable, and the decision has to be made per event rather than by reflex.

Lean toward **piggybacking** when:

- The other event draws the same people to the same city.
- A meaningful share of your audience travels rather than commutes.
- Your event is small enough that being the second stop is an advantage rather than a comparison.

Lean toward **dodging** when:

- The two events compete for the same finite resource: the same sponsors' budgets in the same quarter, the same speakers, the same venue.
- The other event is close enough in subject that attending both feels redundant rather than complementary.

Two adjacency risks the tactic carries, both judgment calls rather than documented rules:

- Attendee fatigue after a large multi-day event.
- Sponsor budget already spent at the bigger show.

Ask a sponsor directly rather than assuming either way.

## 3. "Get Options": carrying windows into the venue conversation

The DevOpsDays guide advises lining up several candidate windows rather than fixing one date before approaching venues, because availability is uneven across a week and a month - "you might find that they can accommodate you better during some parts of the week than others."

Practical shape:

- Carry three to five surviving windows, each already cleared by the constraint checks, so any of them is genuinely acceptable. A window you would refuse is not an option; it is a bluff that collapses when the venue picks it.
- Present them as equivalent rather than ranked. A ranked list invites the venue to offer only the top one and decline.
- Ask what the venue's own quiet periods are. Off-peak windows are where rate flexibility lives, and the venue knows them better than any guess from outside.
- Treat a venue's counter-offer as a new candidate window and put it back through the constraint checks before accepting - an availability win that lands on an unchecked observance is not a win.

## 4. The announcement gate checklist

The hard prerequisite, from the DevOpsDays guide: **a date cannot be announced until there is a known way to handle money.** Discovering the gap late has caused rescheduled and cancelled events. Check all of these before publishing:

- A way to receive money exists: a ticketing arrangement, a payment processor, or an entity that can invoice sponsors - whichever the event's model actually needs.
- Someone is accountable for the money, by name.
- The date itself is decided internally and no longer under discussion.
- Every calendar category is checked or explicitly recorded as outstanding, and the user has seen the outstanding list.
- The dodge-or-piggyback call has been made on every competing event found.
- The trigger chosen from the announcement menu has its own precondition met - a signed venue contract for the venue-locked trigger, a confirmed anchor speaker or an openable CFP for the program-teased one.

Below any of these, the date can be decided but not published. An internal date is still a variable; a published one is a promise, and retracting it costs a recurring event far more than the wait would have.

## 5. Worked example (illustrative) and its negative counterpart

Both examples below use invented events and invented dates. They illustrate the shape of the reasoning only - every date, attendance figure and outcome in them is illustrative, and none should be reused as evidence.

### Positive: a professional-audience conference

A two-day platform-engineering conference for working engineers, audience mostly from three neighbouring countries, second edition.

- **Day type:** weekday, from the employer-time rule (DevOpsDays guide). Tuesday-Wednesday chosen over Thursday-Friday so that neither day is a boundary day.
- **Season:** last edition ran in late spring and sold out slowly; the team proposes the same season as a hypothesis, explicitly labelled as such rather than as a seasonal fact.
- **Constraint depth:** the multi-geography observance rung, promoted because the audience spans three countries. Public holidays verified from each country's official calendar for the specific year; one candidate window dropped because it straddled a public holiday in the country supplying the largest share of attendees.
- **Competing-event scan:** two adjacent-topic conferences found in the same season. One is in the same city two days earlier - the team schedules to abut it deliberately, so travelling attendees make one trip. The other is dodged: same sponsor pool, same quarter.
- **Windows carried to venues:** four, presented as equivalent. The venue offers a fifth in an off-peak week; it goes back through the constraint checks, clears, and is accepted.
- **Announcement:** venue-locked trigger. Money handling confirmed, contract signed, date published.

The deliverable records every rejected window with the constraint it failed - which is what makes next year's selection start ahead rather than from scratch.

### Negative: the same event, done by reflex

- **Day type:** Friday chosen "so people can travel home" - a boundary day serving neither pole, and endorsed by neither guide.
- **Season:** "August is dead, everyone's on holiday" asserted as fact, never tested against the event's own prior editions.
- **Holidays:** last year's observance dates reused. They were lunar and moved; the event lands mid-observance for a substantial part of the audience.
- **Competing-event scan:** only the event family's own homepage checked. The conflict that actually costs attendance comes from an adjacent-topic conference nobody looked for.
- **Piggybacking:** a large event in the same city the week before is treated as a threat and fled, discarding a documented tactic without considering it.
- **Venue:** one date fixed first, then venues called. Every venue is booked; the search stalls with no fallback.
- **Announcement:** date published to claim the slot before ticketing exists. Payment setup takes longer than expected, the on-sale slips twice, and the published date becomes a promise the team cannot yet keep.

Each line in the negative example maps to one failure mode in the skill body; read together they are the same event losing its audience one unchecked assumption at a time.
