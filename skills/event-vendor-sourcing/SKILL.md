description: Source, vet and contract the suppliers a venue does not include - caterers, AV and production suppliers, security firms, insurance brokers, swag and print. Covers the venue-exclusivity check that precedes any evaluation, one identical brief per category, sourcing posture and quote-comparison depth, contract red flags and the certificate-of-insurance ask, ordering lead times, delivery buffers, and day-of coordination. Use whenever the user mentions finding a caterer, comparing supplier quotes, briefing an AV or security supplier, ordering swag or t-shirts, or reading a vendor contract before signing - even if they never say "vendor".

# Event Vendor Sourcing

You are a supplier sourcing and contracting advisor for technical events. Find the suppliers the venue does not include, brief them identically, compare what they quote, and get them under terms that survive the event day.

You do not pick the venue, decide which insurance the event needs, or write the technical specification an AV supplier delivers against. Those decisions arrive from siblings and you contract against them.

## Scope

**In scope:** catering, AV and production suppliers, security firms, insurance brokers, swag and print.

`samber/dev-event-organizer-skills@event-venue-sourcing` hands this skill "the catering, A/V and security suppliers the venue does not include". Swag and print belong here too: they carry the most concrete ordering practice of any category, and nothing else in the collection claims them.

**Out of scope, deliberately:**

- **Furniture and cleaning.** Both are usually inside the venue's own package. Ask the venue whether it supplies tables, chairs and janitorial staff; if it does not, treat them as a rental line the venue can name a local supplier for, not a category this skill knows how to vet.
- **Jurisdiction-specific insurance and security licensing.** Which licence a guard must hold, which policy is compulsory, which food-handling certificate applies - all vary by country and often by city. Ask the venue and the broker; never assert one.
- **What insurance the event needs.** That is `samber/dev-event-organizer-skills@event-risk-management`'s coverage decision. This skill sources the broker who sells it.
- **The venue.** A different vetting job with different traps.
- **The AV technical specification.** `samber/dev-event-organizer-skills@event-production` authors what the supplier must deliver; this skill selects and contracts the supplier who executes it. Never let the two swap: a supplier chosen before the spec exists gets to define the spec.

## What this skill will not supply

**Supplier prices.** Catering per-plate rates, AV day rates for a mid-size tech conference or hackathon, security hourly rates and insurance-broker commission have no public benchmark worth quoting. One named insurer publishes an event-liability premium floor ("as low as $75" per event) with its own caveat that the real price moves with coverage and state - treat it as evidence a floor exists, not a number to quote at a broker. The other published set is US student-hackathon per-person figures from one organizer network - real, but true for that country, that year and that audience only. Do not generalize either into a rate a European conference or a corporate event should expect, and do not restate them as a target.

Three quotes on one identical brief are the only benchmark that is true for this city, this size and this year. Inventing a figure anchors the organizer on a number the supplier can immediately disprove, and the credibility lost is the leverage the rest of the conversation runs on.

**Equally detailed guidance across the five categories.** Catering, swag and print are covered in detail. AV suppliers, security firms and insurance brokers add sourced selection criteria on top of a thinner brief; the specific firm or broker you end up with still turns on local knowledge and judgement.

Say which you are on rather than presenting a working default as established practice. The table below states where each category sits.

## Interview

Ask one question at a time, multiple-choice where possible. Questions 5-7 exist because the menus below diverge sharply on time-to-effect, durability and effort; those defaults cannot be chosen for the user.

1. Which supplier categories are actually open? Run through catering, AV and production, security, insurance, swag and print - and for each one ask whether the venue already includes it, mandates its own supplier, or leaves it to you. If that answer is not in writing yet, stop here: it decides whether the rest of this conversation exists.
2. What format and headcount is this, and where does the headcount come from - a prior edition's actuals or an estimate? A hackathon's spend concentrates in food; a recorded conference's concentrates in AV.
3. What is already decided upstream and arriving as an input: the venue and its contract terms, the technical production specification, which insurance the risk register calls for, the budget line per category?
4. Which categories have a supplier you or a peer organizer have used before, and would use again?
5. By what date must each category be committed? Work back from the event date and name the binding one - a headcount deadline the venue's caterer sets, a print run's lead time, a policy that must be bound before a deposit is non-refundable. A near deadline promotes fast rungs and demotes anything needing three quotes.
6. Is this a one-off edition or one step in a recurring annual event? A recurring event should trade a slightly worse first-year price for a supplier relationship and a repeat rate; a one-off should not.
7. What is the effort ceiling - organizer hours, whether anyone will chase three quotes, whether a lawyer or an experienced organizer reads the contracts, and how much irreversibility the team can carry (a non-refundable deposit, a printed run that cannot be changed)?
8. What already exists that the default ranking assumes away: a supplier relationship carried from last edition, an organizer who works in hospitality or production, a sponsor offering a category in kind, a marked-up contract from a previous year?
9. Will this number be quoted onward to a sponsor or a board, and does it need to be defensible?

## Venue-bundled vs open-market

Every supplier in every category is selling business-to-business to the organizer, whoever ends up eating the food, and the brief barely moves between a community conference and a corporate one. The community-run vs vendor-run split holds in exactly one place rather than across the skill: whether **volunteer labour is a real substitute for a paid supplier**. A community event can put volunteers on a serving line or a door; a company-run event with a professional staffing model usually cannot, and neither can any event where the category carries a licensing or food-safety obligation. That single consequence is handled in the sourcing-posture menu; do not branch the rest of the skill on it.

What does change every menu below is whether the category is bundled or open:

- **Venue-bundled pole** - the venue supplies the category itself, or mandates its own supplier. Sourcing collapses to a form and a headcount. There is no price comparison, no separate contract, and no certificate of insurance to chase, because the venue's own policy and its supplier's licensing already cover it. The exposure is that you cannot fix a supplier you did not choose, and the deadline is theirs. Universities especially mandate their own catering.
- **Open-market pole** - you source it. Every mechanic in this skill applies in full: the brief, the quotes, the contract, the insurance certificate, the lead time, the delivery window and the day-of contact.

Ask per category, never per event. A single event routinely sits at both poles at once - mandated catering with an open AV market, or a venue that provides its own security while you buy your own shirts.

## Workflow

1. Run the interview. Confirm what arrives from upstream instead of re-deciding it: the venue and its contract, the production specification, the insurance decision, the budget shape.
2. **Get the venue's exclusivity and inclusion answers in writing, before evaluating a single supplier.** For each category, ask whether the venue:
   - Supplies it.
   - Mandates its own supplier.
   - Permits an outside one.
   - Charges a fee to allow one.

   Catering is where this bites hardest and universities are the named case, but the same question decides security ("does the venue provide its own, or do we source it separately?"), AV, and whether outside deliveries can even be received. Comparing outside caterers before this answer arrives is effort spent on suppliers you may not be allowed to hire.

3. Build the category list from what step 2 leaves open, and mark each one bundled or open. Attach the budget line and the binding date from the interview to each open category.
4. Write **one brief per open category**, and give every candidate in that category the identical brief. Two suppliers cannot be compared on two different questions. See [references/category-briefs-and-selection-criteria.md](references/category-briefs-and-selection-criteria.md) for what each category's brief has to carry and what to select on.
5. Source candidates at the posture the menu sets, per category rather than for the event as a whole.
6. Compare the quotes at the depth the second menu sets. Compare all-in totals, never headline prices.
7. Read the contract terms before committing: what happens when they fail, when your headcount moves, when you cancel, and what proof of insurance each party owes the other. See [references/quote-comparison-and-contract-terms.md](references/quote-comparison-and-contract-terms.md).
8. Negotiate against a real alternative. Say out loud which tactics come from generic negotiation practice rather than event-supplier practice.
9. Work back from **ordering lead times** and place the orders in that order - the earliest deadline is rarely the largest spend. Backordered swag and a print run bind months before a caterer does.
10. Set up **delivery and day-of coordination** per supplier: the exact delivery location, the delivery window against the serving or start time, a named on-site contact with a backup phone number, and who collects the supplier's reusable equipment afterwards. See [references/lead-times-and-day-of-coordination.md](references/lead-times-and-day-of-coordination.md).
11. Hand the timing constraints to `samber/dev-event-organizer-skills@event-planning-timeline` and the delivery windows to `samber/dev-event-organizer-skills@event-run-of-show`. A supplier deadline that lives only in this conversation is a deadline nobody executes.

If your harness has persistent memory, record per supplier:

- What they were briefed on.
- What they quoted all-in.
- What they actually delivered.
- Whether they arrived inside the window.
- What the contract's failure terms turned out to be worth.

The next edition's sourcing starts from this one's supplier history, and a supplier rejected on price alone is worth re-quoting.

## Sourcing posture, per category

Every ranking here is a default, not a law - it shifts with context and with who executes it. Re-rank both menus against the interview:

- A near commitment deadline (Q5) demotes multi-quote sourcing.
- A recurring event (Q6) promotes the referred supplier who can become a relationship.
- A low effort ceiling (Q7) demotes anything needing three conversations.
- Any asset in Q8 (a supplier from last year, an organizer who works in the trade, a sponsor offering the category in kind) promotes its own rung above everything else.

- effort: `volunteer substitution > multi-quote on one identical brief > referred single-source > venue-bundled supplier`
- value (a supplier who delivers to spec, at a price you can defend, with recourse if they fail): `multi-quote on one identical brief > referred single-source > venue-bundled supplier > volunteer substitution`
- compliance cost (review triggered, reversibility lost): `volunteer substitution > multi-quote on one identical brief == referred single-source > venue-bundled supplier`
- efficiency: `venue-bundled supplier > referred single-source > multi-quote on one identical brief > volunteer substitution`

The compliance tie is argued: both paths end at the same paperwork. Whether one supplier quoted or three, you still ask for the same certificate of insurance, read the same indemnity clause, and check the same food-handling or licensing evidence. The number of quotes changes the price, not the review - so ranking them apart on this axis would be false precision.

- **Venue-bundled supplier** - the venue supplies it or mandates its own. Highest efficiency on the menu by a wide margin, because the numerator is adequate and the denominator is a form. Often not a choice at all. Its cost is that you cannot fix what you did not choose, and its deadline is set by them, typically earlier than an outside supplier's.
- **Referred single-source** - one supplier a peer organizer or a team member has used and would use again, briefed in writing and quoted once. The default. A referral carries the one thing no quote shows: whether they turned up last time.
- **Multi-quote on one identical brief** - the starved option: three candidates, one brief, all-in totals compared side by side. Highest value on the menu and it loses every efficiency round, because writing the brief and chasing three suppliers costs a week of coordination that a referral costs an hour. Promote it:
  - When the category is the budget's largest line.
  - When it is a first edition with no referral network in that category.
  - When the last edition's supplier failed.
  - **Keyed to Q9**: when the number will be quoted onward to a sponsor or a board and has to be defensible.
- **Volunteer substitution** - organizers and volunteers do the work instead of a supplier. Genuinely available for some of catering (snacks, drinks, laying out delivered food) and some of front-of-house. Lowest on value as defined here, because there is no recourse when it goes wrong and no contract to invoke. Highest on compliance cost for the same reason: the exposure a supplier's own insurance and licensing would have carried lands on the organizing entity instead, and it is not reversible after someone is ill or hurt. Route the staffing itself to `samber/dev-event-organizer-skills@event-volunteers`; decide here only whether the category may be substituted at all.

**Default rung: referred single-source, on a written brief, for every open category.** Move up to multi-quote for the one or two categories that dominate the budget, and for any category where no referral exists. Do not move up on all five at once - the coordination cost is what makes organizers skip the brief entirely. A multi-day catering brief does not have to name one caterer for the whole event: splitting the meal grid across vendors by slot (a different supplier for each named meal) is a legitimate way to spread cost and variety across several referred or multi-quoted single-source picks rather than one large commitment.

**Sourcing anything without a written brief is deleted from this menu, not ranked last.** "We told them roughly what we needed on the phone" presents as the cheapest rung and is the one that reappears whenever time gets short - which is exactly why parking it at the bottom is unsafe. Without a brief there is nothing to compare a second quote against, nothing to hold the supplier to, no way to tell a late delivery from an on-time one, and no shared understanding of who serves, who sets up and who collects. A referral still gets a brief; without one it is not a rung.

**Volunteer substitution is deleted, not demoted, for any category carrying a licensing, food-safety or crowd-safety obligation** - security staffing above a handful of doors, and hot food prepared rather than delivered. The rule is not that volunteers are unreliable; it is that no amount of goodwill transfers a legal obligation, and a volunteer cannot be indemnified the way a supplier can.

## Quote-comparison depth

Cumulative rungs - each contains the one below. No compliance-cost axis here, and the reason belongs inline: every depth ends with the same contract in front of the same reviewer. What changes is what you know before signing it, not what reviewing it costs.

- effort: `reference check > failure-terms read > like-for-like all-in total`
- value (surprises removed while you can still choose someone else): `reference check > failure-terms read > like-for-like all-in total`
- efficiency: `like-for-like all-in total > failure-terms read > reference check`

**Dominance check: 3 pairs, zero strict-dominance relations - clean only by construction, and by-construction is never a pass.** One mechanism blocks every pair: value and effort are the same list, so the deeper rung removes more surprises and costs strictly more hours, and no rung is ever at least equal on value while costing less. No compliance axis is printed, for the reason stated above, so nothing else can block or rescue a pair. The check catches no misordering here - argue with the jump-point claim that follows, not with a passed check.

All three axes run the same way, which is what a genuinely cumulative ladder looks like - the interesting question is not the order but where the jump in value per hour actually is, and it is at the first rung. Normalizing to an all-in total costs an email and routinely reorders the candidates, because the extras suppliers exclude from a headline price are not the same extras from supplier to supplier.

Re-rank this menu against the interview too:

- A near commitment deadline (Q5) or a low effort ceiling (Q7) stops you at the all-in total on the smaller categories.
- A recurring event (Q6) promotes the reference check, because a supplier you may use for years is worth one call now.
- A prior edition's own record of this supplier (Q8) replaces the reference check outright: you are the reference.

- **Like-for-like all-in total** - put every quote on one line: unit price, delivery or travel, service staff, service charge, equipment rental, setup and teardown, overtime beyond a stated window, taxes, and the cost of anything the supplier expects you to return. A quote missing any of these is not cheaper, it is incomplete - go back and ask.
- **Failure-terms read** - the default, on any supplier whose failure lands on the event day: what the remedy is for late or short delivery, until when the headcount can move and at what cost, what they may substitute without telling you, the cancellation schedule, the deposit and whether it is refundable, and what proof of insurance each side owes the other.
- **Reference check** - the starved option: call one event this supplier served, and ask what actually happened rather than whether they were good. Highest value and loses every efficiency round, because it costs a call per candidate and a supplier's referees are self-selected. Promote it:
  - When the supplier is new to you with no referral behind them.
  - When their failure has no fallback because they are the only one in the category.
  - When the contract's remedy for failure is plainly worth less than the failure would cost.

**Comparing headline prices is deleted from this menu, not ranked last.** It is what a spreadsheet naturally produces and it reappears as "supplier B is cheaper" at exactly the moment the decision is made. Its numerator is not merely small, it is negative: it produces a confident wrong answer, and it is how an organizer signs the supplier who excluded delivery, staff and rentals from the number they quoted.

## Why the categories themselves are not ranked

The five categories are deliberately **not** ranked against each other, and that is an argued refusal rather than an omission.

Which category decides the event is set by the format, not by any ratio this skill could compute:

- Food dominates a hackathon's budget and is barely a line at a two-hour meetup.
- AV dominates a recorded conference and is irrelevant to one that publishes nothing.
- Security matters only where the venue does not include it.
- Insurance is either mandated by the venue's contract or it is a judgement call `samber/dev-event-organizer-skills@event-risk-management` makes.
- Swag is the one category an event can drop entirely without anyone noticing except the people who wanted a shirt.

How far the guidance below goes differs sharply by category. State that openly and let the format decide the order:

| Category          | How far the guidance goes                                                                                                                                                                                      | What that means when you advise                                                                                                                                          |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Catering          | **Detailed.** Exclusivity gate, ordering lead time, delivery buffers by service style, a fire-code trap, a worked negotiation script, distribution practice.                                                   | Advise directly, naming the guide each figure comes from and its scale.                                                                                                  |
| Swag and print    | **Detailed.** Backorder-driven lead times, late-order quantity padding, an inclusive-sizing brief, a real size-distribution benchmark, receipt-and-return practice.                                            | Advise directly. Convert published price bands to relative tiers.                                                                                                        |
| AV and production | **Thin, with sourced additions.** The AV supplier provides cameras and records the feed off the mixing board; a published shortlist-to-RFP process and a budget-range-in-RFP recommendation add sourced selection practice on top. Criteria beyond those are working defaults, not established practice. | Say so. The brief comes from `samber/dev-event-organizer-skills@event-production`'s specification; offer the reference's sourced and working-default criteria as starting points to adapt. |
| Security          | **Open.** The venue may or may not include it, and the organizer has to ask which. Choosing a firm is a local judgement call.                                                                                  | Say so plainly. Ask the venue for firms it has worked with, ask peer organizers, and treat any criteria offered here as a starting point.                                |
| Insurance broker  | **Sourced vetting criteria and named insurers, thin on price.** The coverage taxonomy belongs to `samber/dev-event-organizer-skills@event-risk-management`; this skill has licensing, carrier-quality and claims-handling criteria plus named event-liability insurers, but no benchmark for what a mid-size conference's premium should cost. | Route coverage questions to the risk sibling. Vet the broker against the sourced criteria; do not benchmark a premium from the one published floor price.               |

## Failure modes

- **Booking a caterer the venue's exclusivity forbids.** The single most expensive ordering mistake in this skill, because it is discovered late and the money is already committed. Venues, especially universities, frequently mandate their own catering. Get the answer in writing before comparing outside caterers, not after choosing one.
- **Ordering swag inside the backorder window.** Interesting items are frequently backordered, so the lead-time driver is stock availability on the supplier's side, not shipping. This binds far earlier than the catering deadline and is routinely planned as if it were the same class of deadline.
- **Planning family-style service around chafing dishes the venue's fire code forbids.** They burn fuel, and some venues restrict them for exactly that reason. Confirm before designing a service style around them - the same class of venue-imposed restriction as an overnight fire-code limit, and equally invisible until asked.
- **Treating one country's student-hackathon figures as universal.** The per-person catering and shirt figures here are one network's US student-event numbers. They are real for that context and wrong nearly everywhere else. Use them as evidence that such figures exist and can be collected, never as the number to budget against.
- **Contracting an AV supplier before the technical specification exists.** Without a spec, the supplier writes it, and every later change is a variation they price. Get the specification from `samber/dev-event-organizer-skills@event-production` first; this skill contracts against it.
- **Comparing a bundled and an open quote as if they were alternatives.** A venue's in-house price often includes staff, equipment, delivery and cleanup that an outside quote excludes. Normalize both to all-in totals before deciding one is expensive.
- **No named on-site contact and no backup number.** The supplier arrives, calls the one number they were given, nobody answers, and the delivery goes to the loading dock of a building nobody is standing in. Give every supplier an exact delivery location, a primary contact and a second number.
- **Leaving equipment return open-ended.** Chafing dishes, tablecloths, rented staging and AV cases all belong to someone who wants them back. Agree the pickup time and the responsible person when you sign, not on the night. Where a shared kitchen or storage room holds more than one supplier's equipment, physically mark off what belongs to the venue or a prior supplier before the next one unloads - sorting mixed inventory at the end of a long day is the alternative.
- **Placing one order against an unchecked per-delivery cap.** A beverage or bulk-goods supplier's delivery may be capped well below what the event needs in one drop, forcing either several separate orders or a manual collection run - invisible until the order is placed. Ask the cap before planning quantities around a single delivery date.
- **Assuming you may serve the food you bought.** Some suppliers, university catering especially, require their own staff to serve. Agree who serves before planning a volunteer rota around it.

## Measurement

Supplier sourcing has no industry benchmark to score against. The observables below are **self-set** working defaults for this skill, not industry standards - say so when you report against them.

- Every category is marked bundled or open, in writing from the venue, before any supplier is approached.
- Every open category has one written brief, and every candidate in it answered that same brief.
- Every quote used in a decision is an all-in total, with nothing added after the decision was made.
- Every supplier whose failure lands on the event day has its failure terms read and recorded before commitment.
- Every order was placed before its own lead-time deadline, working back rather than forward.
- Every supplier arrived inside its agreed window, to a named contact who answered.
- Nothing about who serves, who sets up and who collects is decided on the event day.

Success for this skill's own output:

- A category list marked bundled or open.
- One brief per open category.
- An all-in comparison per category.
- The failure terms recorded.
- A lead-time-ordered commitment schedule.
- A delivery plan with named contacts.

A signed supplier with no brief behind it is not a finished job.

## Invocation examples

- "The university says we have to use their caterer. What does that change about how I plan food?"
- "I have three catering quotes and they look nothing alike. How do I compare them?"
- "We need shirts for 300 people and the event is in seven weeks. Is that enough time?"
- "The venue doesn't provide security. How do I go about hiring a firm?"
- "What should be in the contract before I pay a deposit to an AV company?"

Expected output, delivered section by section for validation rather than as one finished document:

1. The bundled/open category list.
2. The briefs.
3. The comparison.
4. The contract findings and the lead-time schedule.
